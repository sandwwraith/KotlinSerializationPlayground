# KotlinSerializationPlayground

This is a slightly changed version of [elizarov/KotlinMultiplatformPlayground](https://github.com/elizarov/KotlinMultiplatformPlayground)
with [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) included.

Its main purpose is to provide ready-for-use stub of multiplatform project with serialization and 
sample for automated compatibility testing.
